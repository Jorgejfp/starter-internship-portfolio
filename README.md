### Portfolio Project Description for Internship Course

#### Project Overview:
For this project, students will create a professional portfolio website showcasing their work, skills, and experiences. The portfolio will consist of various essential pages, and students will be required to demonstrate their knowledge of web technologies by integrating an API call to fetch data, process it, and expose it through their own API server for others to consume.

#### Project Requirements:

1. **Homepage**:
   - A well-designed homepage introducing the student and their skills.
   - Must include a brief biography, a profile picture, and links to other sections of the portfolio.
   - Should highlight their top projects with a short description and links to the project pages.

2. **Projects Page**:
   - A section that details all projects the student has worked on, including titles, descriptions, and links to the live version or GitHub repository.
   - Each project should have its own dedicated page with more details, technologies used, and any relevant media (screenshots, videos).

3. **Skills/Experience Page**:
   - A page showcasing the student's technical skills and professional experience.
   - Could include a timeline of work history, internships, and projects.
   - Skills should be organized in categories (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Tools, Frameworks).

4. **Contact Page**:
   - A form where potential employers or collaborators can contact the student.
   - Should include validation to ensure that the form is submitted with valid data (e.g., email address format).
   - Could also link to social media profiles or LinkedIn.

5. **Blog (Optional)**:
   - A section for sharing articles or updates on the student's learning journey or projects.
   - Could include a simple content management system to add, edit, or delete posts.

6. **API Integration**:
   - Students must integrate an external API of their choice (e.g., weather data, cryptocurrency prices, GitHub repositories).
   - They must process the data and display it meaningfully within the portfolio (e.g., real-time data, charts, or tables).

7. **API Server**:
   - Create their own API that serves some processed data or personal data from their portfolio (e.g., project details, blog posts, or other data sets).
   - The API must be accessible by others and return data in JSON format.
   - It should have at least one endpoint that users can call to get specific information from the portfolio.

8. **Responsive Design**:
   - The portfolio should be responsive and functional on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
